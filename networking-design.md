# Network design
{: #network-design}

This section expands on the network aspect of the IBM Architecture framework in respect of the Zerto disaster recovery for VMware Cloud Foundation in {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} pattern.

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

The requirements for the network aspect for the Zerto for disaster recovery for VMware workloads pattern focus on the following:

- Replicate the VMware workloads in accordance with the target RPO.
- Internet connectivity â€“ Each ZVM requires internet access, either directly or indirectly through a proxy, for billing purposes. If you do not complete the configuration, Zerto blocks management activities in 15 days. Internet access also used to enable site monitoring using the Zerto Analytics and Zerto Mobile App platforms.
- The ZVM in the protected site must be able to communicate with the ZVM in the recovery site.
- The ZVMs from each site must be able to communicate with the local ESXi hosts and vCenter.
- The VRAs from each site must be able to communicate with the local ZVM.
- The VRAs in the protected site must be able to communicate with the VRAs in the recovery site for the replication and restoration of workloads.
- Cross VPC traffic flow. In this pattern, the connectivity between the protected and recovery site is achieved by using a global transit gateway. The transit gateway is an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} component allowing to easily interconnect {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}s (as well as {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} classic and {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} environments). In the case of a global transit gateway, these resources can be located in different {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} regions.

When you design or deploy this architecture pattern, consider the following:

- Zerto architecture does not support NAT (Network Address Translation) firewalls.
- Design your network flows carefully. For more information about ports and protocols, see [Zerto network ports and protocols](https://help.zerto.com/bundle/Admin.VC.HTML.90/page/Port_Usage.htm).
- Ensure that the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} security groups and firewall rules allow the replication and control traffic.
- Ensure that the networks are properly routed and possible firewall rules allow the required traffic at both source and destination sites.
- Performance:
   - Amount of initial data initialized or synchronized in a VPG.
   - Rate of change of data/RPO - sizes of changed data and data change rate.
- Transit Gateway traffic cost implications.

## Considerations

Here are some key areas that you must keep in mind while designing Zerto replication for Disaster recovery environment on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

Zerto provides documentation specifying the required ports for different components and functionalities. Ensure that the required firewall ports are open between the recovered VMs (e.g.: NSX-T distributed firewall rules) and their eventual external dependencies. |
| **Public Access**                                                                                                                                                                       |Internet Access to connect to Zerto CallHome Server, Zerto support, Zerto Analytics.

# Network design
{: #network-design}

## Requirements
{: #requirements}

Requirements for the network aspect for the Zerto for disaster recovery for VMware workloads pattern focus on:

- Replicate the VMware workloads in accordance with the target RPO.
- Internet connectivity â€“ Each ZVM requires internet access, either directly or indirectly through a proxy, for billing purposes. If you do not complete the configuration, Zerto blocks management activities in 15 days. Internet access also used to enable site monitoring that uses the Zerto Analytics and Zerto Mobile App platforms.
- The ZVM in the protected site must be able to communicate with the ZVM in the recovery site.
- The ZVMs from each site must be able to communicate with the local ESXi hosts and vCenter.
- The VRAs from each site must be able to communicate with the local ZVM.
- The VRAs in the protected site must be able to communicate with the VRAs in the recovery site for the replication and restoration of workloads.
- Cross VPC traffic flow. In this pattern, the connectivity between the protected and recovery site is achieved by using a global transit gateway. The transit gateway is an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} component facilitating interconnect {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}}s (as well as {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} classic and {{site.data.keyword.powerSys_notm}} environments). If the environment includes a global {{site.data.keyword.tg_short}}, these resources can be located in different {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} regions.

Consider the folloiwng when you design or deploy this architecture pattern:

- Zerto architecture does not support NAT (Network Address Translation) firewalls.
- Design your network flows carefully. For more information about ports and protocols, see [Zerto network ports and protocols](https://help.zerto.com/bundle/Admin.VC.HTML.90/page/Port_Usage.htm).
- Ensure that the {{site.data.keyword.vpc_short}} security groups and firewall rules allow the replication and control traffic.
- Ensure that the networks are properly routed and possible firewall rules allow the required traffic at both source and destination sites.
- Performance:
   - Amount of initial data that is initialized or synchronized in a VPG.
   - Rate of change of data/RPO - sizes of changed data and data change rate.
- Transit Gateway traffic cost implications.

| **Firewall Configuration:**                                                                                                                                                                   | **Ports and Protocols:** Ensure that the necessary ports and protocols are open in the firewalls between Zerto components, VMware infrastructure, and any other relevant systems. Zerto documentation specifies the required ports for different components and functions. Ensure that the required firewall ports are open between the recovered VMs (e.g.: NSX-T distributed firewall rules) and their eventual external dependencies. |
| **Public Access**                                                                                                                                                                       |**Internet Access** to connect to Zerto CallHome Server, Zerto support, Zerto Analytics. **Proxy or NAT connection**, for example by using the VPC subnet public gateway. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Network Segmentation:**                                                                                                                                                                     | **Isolation**: Segment the network to isolate the Zerto components from other critical infrastructure. This isolation can enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Secure Communication:**                                                                                                                                                                     | **TLS/SSL Encryption:** Enable TLS/SSL encryption for communication between Zerto components to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit. **Secure Communication with VMware:** When interacting with VMware infrastructure, it is essential to utilize secure communication protocols, adhering to best practices for securing VMware environments, to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, as well as to protect against unauthorized access and potential security threats.                                                                                          |
| **DNS Configuration:**                                                                                                                                                                        | **Name Resolution:** Ensure proper DNS configuration for Zerto components and VMware infrastructure to enable seamless name resolution. Properly configured DNS is essential for the identification and communication between components. Update the DNS records to point to the recovered VMs.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Time Synchronization:**                                                                                                                                                                     | **NTP (Network Time Protocol):** Synchronize the clocks across Zerto components, VMware hosts, and other relevant systems using that use NTP to ensure accurate timestamps for logs and data consistency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Redundancy and High Availability:**                                                                                                                                                         | **Redundant Network Paths:** Configure redundant network paths to provide high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring that a failure in one path does not disrupt data transfer operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
